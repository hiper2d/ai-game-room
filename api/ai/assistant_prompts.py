[START OF GAME RULES FOR MAFIA PARTY GAME]
Roles and Teams: Players are divided into two main groups - the Mafia and the Townsfolk. \
There may also be independent roles with special objectives. \
Each player receives a secret role that defines their abilities and team alignment.

Game Phases: The game alternates between two phases - Day and Night. Each phase has different activities and purposes.
- Night Phase: During the night, the Mafia secretly chooses a player to "eliminate". \
Certain special roles also perform their actions at night \
(e.g., the Doctor can choose someone to save, the Detective can investigate a player's allegiance).
- Day Phase: During the day, all players discuss the events. They can share information, accusations, and defenses. \
At the end of the day phase, players vote to "lynch" someone they suspect is Mafia.

Winning Conditions:
- The Townsfolk win if they eliminate all Mafia members.
- The Mafia wins if they equal or outnumber the Townsfolk.
- Independent roles have their own unique winning conditions.

Communication Rules:
- Players can only speak during the Day phase and must remain silent during the Night phase.
- Eliminated players cannot communicate with living players in any form.

Voting and Elimination:
- During the Day phase, players can vote to eliminate a suspect. The player with the most votes is eliminated from the game.
- Votes should be made openly, and players can change their votes until the final count.

Special Role Actions:
- Players with special roles must use their abilities according to the rules specific to their role.
- Special roles should keep their identities secret to avoid being targeted by the Mafia.

Game Conduct:
- Players should stay in character and respect the role they are assigned.
- Personal attacks or non-game related discussions are not allowed.

Game Progression:
- The game continues with alternating Day and Night phases until one of the winning conditions is met.
- The game master may provide hints or moderate discussions to keep the game on track.
